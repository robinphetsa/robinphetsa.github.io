My name is Robin. My background is in statistics from which I received a Bachelors of Science in from the University of California Santa Barbara. I am currently a web developer working mainly with the ASP.Net framework but I have dabbled with Django. I use my knowledge of programming and statistics to perform analytics on open source data sets. My main area of interests are in data visualization and building machine learning models. For my work I use both R Studio and Python Notebook along with the data science librarys that accompany it.

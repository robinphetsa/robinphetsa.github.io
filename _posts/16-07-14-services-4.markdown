title: Predicting Automobile MPG's with the Cash for Clunkers Data Set
description: |
---
  In this project, I use R to to analyze the Cash for Clunkers data set to see what factors affect a specific automobile's fuel efficiency. I then use that analysis to build a model to see if I can predict the MPG of the cars in the dataset. [See it here!](/doc/Predicing Automobile Fuel Efficiency.pdf)

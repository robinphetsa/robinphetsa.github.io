title: Machine Learning with R - Conditional Forest Algorithm vs Extreme Gradient Boosting
description: |
---
In these two R scripts, I apply a conditional forest model along with an extreme boosting model onto our Titanic data set to see how well it they do in comparison to our first model: the logistic regression model built with SciKit-Learn. [Conditional Forest Model](https://github.com/robinphetsa/Data-Science/blob/master/Titanic/CForestTitanic%20-%20Best%20Model.R) VS. [XGBoost](https://github.com/robinphetsa/Data-Science/blob/master/Titanic/xgboosttitanic.R)
